  <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>
  <p>"The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won’t. 
    It’s whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere. 
    Hard work, persistence, and dedication—these are what turn ordinary people into extraordinary ones.
    Nothing worth achieving comes easily, and the road will be long and filled with obstacles, but it is through that journey that we grow, that we find our strength, and that we truly succeed."
