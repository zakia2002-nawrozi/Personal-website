    <p>
     My name is Zakia Nawrozi. I am a medical student who stays hopeful and keeps growing, even during hard times.I love learning new things and always try to use my time wisely.
     When universities closed, I didn't lose hope and try to use my time in a best possible way, and now I discovered a passion for coding and worked hard to learn it.
      I enjoy solving problems and learning quickly, which makes me more confident and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a hardworking girl who never gives up. I also love spending time with my family, watching movies, and listening to music.
       My future goal is to pass the USMLE exam and become a successful doctor. I believe that with dedication, patience, and continuous learning, I can achieve my dreams and make a positive difference in the world.
